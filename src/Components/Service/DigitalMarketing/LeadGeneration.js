                  <p>What is the purpose of digital marketing or online promotion if you do not get the desired results
                    for your business? The desired results are evaluated by the percentage of leads website can
                    generate for the business. This is when we need to nurture potential customers and bring them to
                    the website and end up converting them successfully. Usually, 5-10% of qualified leads convert
                    successfully, the remaining 90-95% traffic lose interest and fall off elsewhere. Here is when
                    effective lead generation strategy could help you stop your traffic from losing interest. </p>

              <h3>What is Lead Generation?</h3>
              It is a technique used by marketers and online promotion experts to target and nurture prospective customers
              for the products and services of a business. Experts identify strategies in line with the company’s business
              goals and implement them as an attempt to drive traffic to the website and increase sales. <p />
              <p>
                The process targets potential customers who take some interest in the company’s products and services and
                acquires their contact information and does not target cold prospects.</p>
