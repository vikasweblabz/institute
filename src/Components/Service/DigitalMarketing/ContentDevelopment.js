                  <h3>What is Content?</h3>
                  <p> An impressive design can bring traffic to your website and mobile application, but only a quality
                    content has the power to influence human minds to stay on your page for long and keep returning to
                    it again and again. Content rules the world and we can see it in almost every dimension of our
                    life. Any text, image, video, audio or infographics is content and the effort we put in creating
                    these is content development. </p>
